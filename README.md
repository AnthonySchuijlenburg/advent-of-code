# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges. The solutions will be written in Typescript, and will include tests with Vitest.
Every year and every day have their own (sub-)folder with the example input and the solution. As requested by the creator, the personalized datasets are not included in this repository.

## Running a Solution

To run a solution, use the following command:

```bash
npx ts-node src/20XX/XX/NameOfFile.ts
```

Make sure that inside the XX folder, there is a file called `input.txt` that contains the input for the challenge.
